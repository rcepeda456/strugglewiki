andriod app using SQL lite

"	Collaborated with a team of four to create an application in Android studios using Java and XML. 
The application queried the users input and added it to the SQL database the user was able to Update, Edit or Remove their data 
from the database.


The reason why we named this project Struggle Production was because it was our first time creating a database and
using it in a mobile app. we came though many problems but all and all my team and I got the job done in a matter of a week.
